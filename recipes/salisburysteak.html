    <h2>Who needs frozen TV dinners when you can make the snake yourself?</h2>
    <p>Salisbury steak with a savory onion sauce. This yummy recipe has been in my family for years. It's easy to cook but tastes like it took hours to make!
        <br> I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <uo>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> This Salisbury steak recipe starts with 1.5 pounds of ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned Soup:</strong> A can of condensed French onion soup adds moisture, richness, and flavor to the patties. It also serves as the base for the gravy.</li>

        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps hold the patties together.</li>
